SpatialBench is a high-performance geospatial benchmark for generating synthetic spatial data at scale. Inspired by the Star Schema Benchmark (SSB) and real-world mobility data like the NYC TLC dataset, SpatialBench is designed to evaluate spatial query performance in modern data platforms.

Built in Rust and powered by Apache Arrow, SpatialBench brings fast, scalable, and streaming-friendly data generation for spatial workloadsâ€”minimal dependencies, blazing speed.

SpatialBench provides a reproducible and scalable way to evaluate the performance of spatial data engines using realistic synthetic workloads.

Goals:

Establish a fair and extensible benchmark suite for spatial data processing.
Help users compare engines and frameworks across different data scales.
Support open standards and foster collaboration in the spatial computing community.
